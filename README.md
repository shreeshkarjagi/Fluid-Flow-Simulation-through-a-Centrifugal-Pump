# Fluid-Flow-Simulation-through-a-Centrifugal-Pump

This project uses SimScale to run an incompressible fluid flow simulation on a centrifugal pump using rotating zones. In order to run this simulation, I had to model a rotating region, assign material and boundary conditions and then create the mesh.

** I followed the typical SimScale workflow: **
  1. Prepare the CAD model for the simulation
  2. Set up the simulation
  3. Create a mesh
  4. Run the simulation and analyze results
