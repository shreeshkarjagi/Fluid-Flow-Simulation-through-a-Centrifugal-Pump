# Fluid-Flow-Simulation-through-a-Centrifugal-Pump

This project uses SimScale to run an incompressible fluid flow simulation on a centrifugal pump using rotating zones. In order to run this simulation, I had to model a rotating region, assign material and boundary conditions and then create the mesh.
